<h2>Useage Instructions</h2>
<p>Every search made using Trendalyzer must have a few important components. Key of which are <b>the Queries</b> and <b>the Timeframe</b>.</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <h3>The Queries:</h3>
    <p>Key to each search, the queries are what keywords Trendalyzer will be searching for. Whether it's a list of Olympic sports, Web browsers (it's <i>Google</i> trends though, so maybe not the best idea), or           even numbers from 1 to 25 inclusive (did a <i>lot</i> of that while testing), they are the keywords that you want analyzed. Simply add a query by clicking on the big grey button with the "+" sign, or remove        one
       by clicking on it in the "queries" gutter. Unlike vanilla Google Trends, Trendalyzer will allow you to compare as many queries as your heart desires. Yep, no more labouring away, doing 5 queries at a time,         and compiling all of them to a final document. Aren't you so happy :)</p>
  </li>

    <h3>The Timeframe:</h3>
    <p>Another essential part of every search, the timeframe is well ... the timeframe (Someone, help me). After all, no one wants data from 2004 (ewwwww) on their sparkly presentation on the popularity of TikTok vs Reddit. Neither existed invented in 2004! (Not a factorial symbol) By using the timeframe feature, however, you'll be able to constrain the data just to after both were invented, so you get a nice, clean presentation. Yippee!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3>The Region, Search type, and Search category:</h3>
    <p>In addition to the timeframe and queries, you can also customize the Region, Search type, and Search category of the data Trendalyzer will be spitting out. The Region is the location of the data that   
      Trendalyzer will be presenting. For example, if you wanted to just look at the popularity of pets in Mexico, you can customize that by scrolling all the way through the list of countries, and selecting   
      Mexico (Sorry, will be working on search feature soon). As well as that, you could also look at the popularity of certain pets on youtube, by customizing the Search type, or popularity of pets in the well... Pets and Animal category by changing your search category. Even better, why don't you do all 3! (Still not a factorial symbol)  </p>
